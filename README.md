# Kaomoji picker for bemenu

This script is a fork of bemoji by Marty Oehme.
Much of the functionality of bemoji is gone because I did not want it.
Comes with a pkgbuild file for arch linux.
By default only works with bemenu and wl-clipboard.
The script is very easy to edit to change this.
You can change it from wlcopy to xclip on line 138.
You can change from bemenu to any dmenu-compatible menu on line 42.
